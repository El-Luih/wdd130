        <p>Hi! My name is Luis Maradiaga. I'm from a small country in Central America called Honduras and this is my
            first time creating a proper HTML file!
            That should be interesting. Also, I couldn't find a decent picture of myself so I just used this image, hope
            that's not a problem.</p>

        <p>Honduras is a tropical country located in the very middle of Central America, between Nicaragua and
            Guatemala. Having access to two oceans, it's known for the beautiful beaches of Roatan in the Atlantic, the
            volcanic island of Amapala in the Pacific and the ancient mayan ruins of Copan.</p>
