            <p>Hi! My name is Luis Maradiaga. I'm from a small country in Central America called Honduras and this is my
                first time creating a proper HTML file!
                That should be interesting. Also, I couldn't find a decent picture of myself, so
                there is the picture of a potato lamp that I found on Amazon, it's pretty cute. I Hope
                that's not a problem. I was thinking about typing the standard greek gibberish we use to fill text
                spaces
                (which is actual gibberish, it's purposefully made to make no sense after all),
                since I can't think on anything else of interest about myself, but I suppose this excuse should suffice.
                Or
                not, I give up. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Labore minima atque, error

            <p>Honduras is a tropical country located in the very middle of Central America, between Nicaragua and
                Guatemala. Having access to two oceans, it's known for the beautiful beaches of Roatan in the Atlantic,
                the
                volcanic island of Amapala in the Pacific and the ancient mayan ruins of Copan.</p>
